    "## Section 1.6 – Custom Functions\n",
    "### Writing Functions in Python\n",
    "We have already discussed how useful functions are, and we've tried the `pow` function in C. In python, we can write this ourselves: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def pow(x, y):\n",
    "    return x ** y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For the benefit of easy reference, let's repeat the breakdown of each component. The first line is called the **signature**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def pow(x, y):\n",
    "```\n",
    "* `def` \n",
    " * This keyword indicates this is a *function definition*\n",
    "* `pow`\n",
    " * The name of the function, this is what we will *call* later\n",
    "* `(x, y)`\n",
    " * We list all of the *parameters* (inputs) of the function and give them variable names – we can call them whatever we like\n",
    "* `:` \n",
    " * This colon indicates the start of a new *block* of code\n",
    " * At least one but possibly more of the following lines of code will *belong* to this function\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's add the second line:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def pow(x, y):\n",
    "    return x ** y\n",
    "```\n",
    "* `⇥` \n",
    " * Notice this line is *indented* – there are four spaces (or a *tab* character) at the start of this line\n",
    " * If a line ends in a colon `:` then the next line ***must*** be indented\n",
    " * Every indented line is considered part of the same block of code – in this case, part of the same function\n",
    "* `return`\n",
    " * This keyword indicates that we are ending the function and the result of evaluating the expression on the right hand side will be *returned* (outputted)\n",
    "* `x ** y`\n",
    " * Finally, this is the calculation that the function will do with the input parameters `x` and `y`\n",
    " \n",
    "Here is a demonstration of this function in action that you can run and play around with. I have renamed the function to `my_pow` so we can demonstrate it is not just the same as the builtin function `pow`:"
